# Crossover
AI-powered app to feed your curiosity for basketball!

## Inspiration
When thought about it, the idea itself felt quite interesting to us in the first place; and since there are also people who've been interested in basketball but never got to learn much about it, we felt like it would be quite exciting for them to utilize AI to detect and learn about various moves and objects in the world of basketball!

## What it does
Be it any object or any move that is related to basketball, it's immediately able to recognize and display all the information about it in realtime through your device's camera! 

## How we built it
The various technologies and languages that we've used to build this project are:
- Figma
- HTML
- JS
- Teachable Machine
- Tensorflow.js

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Being a project that's quite unique and informative in itself, it actually helped us learn in detail about some of the facts about basketball that weren't known to us ever before!

On top of that, we got to learn and experience the Teachable Machine platform by Google, through which we learnt how to build our own model and utilize the platform's API for realtime object detection within a browser!
